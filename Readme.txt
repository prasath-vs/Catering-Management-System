In this project using C++, we are going to make “Catering Management System” which will be used to calculate various things like cost for servants, food etc. We are going to make this using simple and easy to understand C++ features and functionalities. In this program the user can find out the cost required for food and number of servants needed in an event (Ex: wedding function). It will also have the option to display the average cost per person. It can give an estimate of costs based on the event’s duration and approximate number of people coming to that event. After getting the approximate total cost for catering service it will also display an advance amount to be paid to book the catering service on that particular day. The advance amount will be 10 – 20% the total amount. This program will be useful to know a rough estimate about catering service for an event.
